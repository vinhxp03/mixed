Fixed: 
- After cannot fixed this issue, I tried to Fake IP and it work

Or change Windows 10 DNS:
- Open Control Pane > Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings
- Select and check the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) option
- Set (Google Public DNS): 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4
